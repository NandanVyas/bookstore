        We reserve the right to allocate and ship books among our subscribers in any manner that we, in our sole and
        absolute discretion, determine. In addition, we will, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine the
        quantity of books we purchase for any particular title and the level of staffing and number of shipments to be
        processed at each distribution centre. As a result, we may not always send you the top choices from your queue,
        and we may not ship out your next book(s) on the same day that we receive one from you. At present, our goal is
        to ship you the book(s) listed highest in your queue. Often, on the same day that we receive a book(s) from you,
        we will ship the next available book(s) from your queue. In certain instances, your next available book(s) will
        not ship until at least one business day following our receipt of your returned book(s). Other factors that may
        affect delivery times, include, but are not limited to, (i) the distance between the distribution centre from
        which your book(s) was shipped and your delivery address, (ii) the timing of your placement or adjustment of
        books in your queue. We do not process returns or deliveries on National Holidays. We make no guarantee as to
        the shipping and delivery of book(s) and may in our sole and absolute discretion, change our business practice
        regarding allocation, delivery and shipping, without notice. We may from time to time revise these Terms of Use
        but we will not necessarily provide you notice of the revisions. It is up to you to review the Terms of Use
        frequently to determine if there have been any changes made. NVBookstore™ reserves the right to request return
        of any and all book(s) in the possession of Members at any time. Members understand and agree to promptly return
        any book(s) to NVBookstore™ upon request, and that failure to do so within five days of the request makes
        Members liable for the cost of those book(s) plus 50% of that cost as a handling charge, for which NVBookstore™
        reserves the right to charge the Member&quot;s refundable security deposit.
